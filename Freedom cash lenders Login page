May require good credit: Although many lenders say they can process your application within one working day, this generally applies to applicants with good credit. If you have only fair or poor credit, the lender will typically look into your application in more detail, which can slow the process, as well as lead to rejection.
Smaller choice of lenders: Only a small number of lenders offer same-day turnaround times for loans, so your choice is limited. Fewer lenders can also mean less competition on rates and terms.
